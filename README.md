# OnePlus Logo Glyph

##What?
OnePlus logo glyph created in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and traced from the original found on [oneplus.net](https://oneplus.net/press-resources).

Shared with the [Sketch App Sources Community](https://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/2314-oneplus-vector-logo-sketch-freebie-resource.html)

If you don't have [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) I've included a hi-res export PNG file which you can also use.

##Why?
I was designing a wallpaper for a contest sponsored by [OnePlus](http://www.oneplus.net) in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) which I love and learning. I thought it would be cool to create the logo and to share it with others for fun.
